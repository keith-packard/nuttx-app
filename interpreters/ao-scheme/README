To use ao-scheme with NuttX, first you need to install the ao-scheme
package. That package provides all of the scheme interpreter source
code that can then be compiled for the NuttX system.

	$ git clone git://keithp.com/git/ao-scheme
	$ cd ao-scheme
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ make install

* No bytevectors
* Characters are just numbers
* No dynamic-wind or exceptions
* No environments
* No syntax-rules; (it does have classic macros)
* No record types
* No libraries
